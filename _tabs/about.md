## 👋 &nbsp; Hello, I'm Nick

I'm a data scientist with interests in software development and machine learning. I originally went to school with the intent of studying medicine, but found my passion for math and coding along the way. This has led me to pursue a Master's in Computer Science from Georgia Tech. Outside of work and school, I enjoy weightlifting, playing video games + chess, and traveling. 

The main purpose of this website is to post my notes from school and any self learning endeavors. I learn most effectively when I take well-structured notes; by sharing my notes online, I hope to hold myself accountable in terms of their consistency and quality.
